# Tetris Game with Python

This game is built with Python using the Pygame library.

## Gameplay

In Tetris, your goal is to manipulate different-shaped blocks as they fall from the top of the screen to create horizontal lines without any gaps. When you complete a line, it disappears, and you earn points. The game ends when the blocks stack up to the top of the screen
